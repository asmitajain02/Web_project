	<h1>Hello All</h1>
	<p>Welcome to DevOps Website</p>
	<p>DevOps is one of the hottest buzzwords in tech now, although it is much more than buzz. It is a collaboration between the development 
		and operations team, where they work together to deliver a product faster and efficiently. In the past few years, there has been a 
		tremendous increase in job listings for DevOps engineers.</p>
    <h3>Thanks for reading</h3>
